### Use command @shrt for making shortcut command of Git Clone packages. For example Blackeye or else.

Lets take a example I have cloned a git packages in my termux $ Home Directory and there It is stored in a 

Blackeye named Directory . For Using the Blackeye tool I have to change my directory to Blackeye and 

then I have to run the file by using python2 blackeye.py Command but after this file

I made a shortcut handle only by running @shrt and input the Directory name Blackeye and after 

that input the command line python2 blackeye.py and finally created a shortcut handle name as @be and hit enter

Now After sucess message I xan run Blackeye command from anywhere in termux only using a sing command @be 

no need to change directory and no need to type a long command . That's it !

### Use @shc for package based command shortcuts . For Example python , bash , figlet , fish etc.

Lets take a example as if we shorted python command to p command then 

we have to use only p wherever python is required . For example 

we have to write python script.py for running particular script.py

but after this tool we have to command only p script.py .

```

$ @shrt

```

* Now you can create Shortcut Handle of any package using this command 

```

```

### USE @shrtlist For VIEWING YOUR SHORTCUTS HANDLES RESPECTIVELY.
